# OxfordCYTutorial
The included sagemath python jupyter notebook, is designed to accompany tutorial 2 of the String Theory Compactification course of the Oxford ML conference 2023 (https://mlinmathsandphysics2023.web.ox.ac.uk/).  

The notebook uses a sagemath kernel for symbolic manipulation. Sage can be downloaded from: https://www.sagemath.org/, or otherwise the notebook can be run in the CoCalc online cell for sagemath: https://cocalc.com/.  

Cells are to be run sequentially, overall using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to solve a system of differential equations on P1. A list of suitable extensions are also suggested at the end of the notebook.
